# Task 14 Implementation Summary

## Enhanced Command Line Interface for Multi-Model Support

### What was implemented:

#### 1. Enhanced Argument Parser
- Added `--model` for single model benchmarking
- Added `--models` for comma-separated list of models
- Added `--all-models` flag to benchmark all available models
- Added `--parallel` flag for concurrent execution
- Maintained backward compatibility with `--provider` (deprecated)

#### 2. Model Validation
- Integrated with the provider registry to validate model names
- Shows clear error messages for invalid models
- Lists all available models when validation fails
- Maps models to their providers during validation

#### 3. Multi-Model Execution
- Sequential execution by default for multiple models
- Parallel execution with `--parallel` flag (up to 4 concurrent)
- Proper error handling for individual model failures
- Aggregated results display with comparison table

#### 4. Results Display
- Single model: Traditional detailed view
- Multiple models: Comparison table sorted by score
- Shows provider, score, success/failure counts, and execution time
- CSV export supports multiple model results

#### 5. Example Usage

```bash
# Single model
python run_benchmarks.py --model gemini-1.5-flash --dataset truthfulness

# Multiple models
python run_benchmarks.py --models gemini-1.5-flash,gpt-4,claude-3-opus-20240229 --dataset truthfulness

# All available models
python run_benchmarks.py --all-models --dataset truthfulness

# Parallel execution
python run_benchmarks.py --models gpt-4,claude-3-opus-20240229 --dataset truthfulness --parallel

# Backward compatibility (deprecated)
python run_benchmarks.py --provider google --dataset truthfulness
```

### Key Changes to run_benchmarks.py:

1. **Imports**: Added support for concurrent execution and registry
2. **Removed hardcoded providers**: Now uses dynamic registry
3. **Updated run_benchmark()**: Takes model name instead of provider
4. **Enhanced main()**: Handles multiple model selection methods
5. **Model validation**: Checks all models before execution
6. **Parallel execution**: Uses ThreadPoolExecutor for concurrent runs
7. **Results aggregation**: Shows comparison table for multiple models

### Test Coverage:

Created comprehensive test suite (`tests/test_run_benchmarks_cli.py`) covering:
- Single model execution
- Multiple models via comma-separated list
- All models flag
- Parallel execution
- Backward compatibility
- Invalid model handling
- Mixed valid/invalid models
- CSV output with multiple models
- Result sorting by score
- Error handling in parallel execution

### Benefits:

1. **Flexibility**: Users can benchmark any combination of models
2. **Performance**: Parallel execution speeds up multi-model benchmarks
3. **Comparison**: Easy side-by-side comparison of model performance
4. **Discovery**: `--all-models` helps users test all available models
5. **Migration**: Backward compatibility eases transition from old CLI

### Integration Notes:

- Works seamlessly with the provider registry system
- Compatible with all registered providers (Google, OpenAI, Anthropic)
- Maintains existing CSV export functionality
- Exit codes properly reflect success/partial failure/complete failure
