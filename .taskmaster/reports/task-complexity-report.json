			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 12,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the enhanced fine-tuning pipeline into components: recipe system implementation, dataset preparation pipeline, real-time visualization dashboard, checkpoint management, hyperparameter optimization, pre-configured recipe templates, distributed training setup, evaluation suite, CLI interface, monitoring integration, and cost estimation features",
			"reasoning": "This task involves building a comprehensive system with multiple complex components including ML pipelines, real-time visualization, distributed computing, and optimization algorithms. Each component requires significant implementation effort and testing."

			"taskTitle": "Build Comprehensive Before/After Evaluation Framework",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 10,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the evaluation framework into: AutoBenchmarkRunner implementation, side-by-side comparison interface, performance metrics dashboard extensions, cost/benefit analyzer, report generator, fine-tuning pipeline integration, evaluation templates, A/B testing framework, custom metric plugin system, and multi-format data export functionality",
			"reasoning": "This task requires sophisticated statistical analysis, visualization components, and integration with multiple existing systems. The A/B testing and automated benchmarking add significant complexity."

			"taskId": 13,
			"taskTitle": "Create Interactive Fine-Tuning Studio",
			"complexityScore": 10,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 15,
			"expansionPrompt": "Structure the fine-tuning studio into: React frontend setup with TypeScript, main dashboard component, experiment manager interface, live preview WebSocket system, A/B testing UI, dataset explorer, quality analysis dashboard, FastAPI backend, WebSocket server, deployment pipeline, authentication system, experiment versioning, automated testing suite, collaboration features, and model card generation",
			"reasoning": "This is the most complex task, requiring full-stack development with real-time features, complex UI components, deployment automation, and enterprise features like authentication and collaboration. The WebSocket implementation and one-click deployment add significant technical challenges."

			"taskId": 14,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Visual Performance Analytics",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down visual analytics into: MetricsDashboard with real-time charts, ResponseComparisonView with diff highlighting, TaskEvaluationPanel for domain metrics, ModelBehaviorAnalyzer with embedding visualization, RegressionDetector with alerting, unified dashboard interface, WebSocket integration for live updates, and Redis caching layer",
			"reasoning": "While complex, this task focuses primarily on visualization and analysis without the deployment and infrastructure concerns of other tasks. The main challenges are real-time updates and sophisticated visualizations."

			"taskId": 15,
			"taskTitle": "Optimize for MacBook Pro Hardware",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 9,
			"expansionPrompt": "Organize hardware optimization into: hardware detection system, Metal/MLX acceleration implementation, memory optimization strategies, background training mode, quick iteration pipeline, hardware-specific configurations, monitoring dashboard for Mac metrics, thermal management integration, and seamless framework integration",
			"reasoning": "This task requires deep understanding of Apple Silicon architecture, Metal programming, and memory management. The platform-specific optimizations and need for fallback mechanisms add complexity."
