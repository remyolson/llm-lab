# Task ID: 14
# Title: Build Privacy-Preserving Pipeline
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 13
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement differential privacy and other privacy-preserving techniques for synthetic data
# Details:
Implement differential privacy engine with configurable epsilon values. Create k-anonymity validation system. Build synthetic record verification to prevent data leakage. Implement privacy budget management. Add noise injection and attribute generalization capabilities. Ensure GDPR, HIPAA, CCPA compliance validation. Create audit trail for privacy guarantees.

# Test Strategy:
Test differential privacy with various epsilon values. Validate k-anonymity enforcement. Test for data leakage using membership inference attacks. Verify compliance with privacy regulations.
