# Task ID: 32
# Title: Build Attention Analysis System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 31
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement comprehensive attention pattern visualization and analysis
# Details:
Create AttentionAnalyzer class with extract_attention_patterns(), visualize_attention_heads(), and analyze_attention_specialization() methods. Support multi-head and multi-layer attention extraction. Build attention rollout and flow visualization. Implement attention pattern comparison across models. Create interactive attention heatmaps.

# Test Strategy:
Test attention extraction from various transformer architectures. Validate visualization accuracy. Test attention pattern comparison. Verify interactive visualizations work correctly.
