# Task ID: 4
# Title: Develop Vulnerability Detection Engine
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the core security scanning engine that detects vulnerabilities by analyzing model responses to attack prompts
# Details:
Create SecurityScanner class with scan_model(), generate_attack_prompts(), and assess_vulnerability() methods as specified in PRD. Implement response analysis using pattern matching, keyword detection, sentiment analysis, and ML-based classification. Support multiple detection strategies: rule-based (regex patterns), ML-based (fine-tuned classifiers), and heuristic approaches. Include confidence scoring for vulnerability assessments. Implement parallel scanning for performance. Support configurable severity thresholds and test suite selection.

# Test Strategy:
Test vulnerability detection accuracy with known vulnerable and safe responses. Validate parallel scanning performance and consistency. Test with various attack types and verify correct severity classification. Measure false positive/negative rates against baseline dataset.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design SecurityScanner Class Architecture [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design the core SecurityScanner class structure with well-defined interfaces for scan_model(), generate_attack_prompts(), and assess_vulnerability() methods
### Details:
Create detailed class design including method signatures, input/output specifications, and internal data structures. Define interfaces for pluggable detection strategies (rule-based, ML-based, heuristic). Design configuration schema for severity thresholds and test suite selection. Plan async/parallel execution architecture for performance optimization.

## 2. Implement Multi-Strategy Detection System [done]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Build the core vulnerability detection logic supporting rule-based, ML-based, and heuristic detection strategies with pluggable architecture
### Details:
Implement rule-based detection using regex patterns and keyword matching for known vulnerability signatures. Create ML-based detection framework supporting fine-tuned classifiers for nuanced vulnerability identification. Develop heuristic detection algorithms for behavioral analysis and anomaly detection. Build strategy orchestrator to combine multiple detection approaches with weighted scoring.

## 3. Build Response Analysis Engine [done]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Develop comprehensive response analysis capabilities including pattern matching, sentiment analysis, and contextual understanding
### Details:
Implement advanced pattern matching for identifying dangerous outputs, data leakage, and prompt compliance violations. Integrate sentiment analysis to detect emotional manipulation and social engineering attempts. Build contextual analyzer to understand semantic meaning and detect subtle vulnerabilities. Create response tokenizer and parser for structured analysis.

## 4. Implement Confidence Scoring System [done]
### Dependencies: 4.2, 4.3
### Description: Create sophisticated confidence scoring mechanism that provides calibrated vulnerability assessment scores with explanations
### Details:
Design multi-factor scoring algorithm considering detection strategy outputs, pattern match strengths, and contextual indicators. Implement score calibration using historical data and benchmarks. Create explainability module to provide reasoning for confidence scores. Build score aggregation logic for multiple vulnerabilities in single response.

## 5. Optimize Parallel Scanning Performance [done]
### Dependencies: 4.2, 4.3, 4.4
### Description: Implement high-performance parallel scanning capabilities with resource management and result aggregation
### Details:
Build async/parallel execution framework using asyncio or multiprocessing for concurrent vulnerability scanning. Implement intelligent batching and resource pooling for optimal throughput. Create result aggregation pipeline handling parallel scan outputs. Design rate limiting and backpressure mechanisms to prevent system overload. Implement progress tracking and cancellation support.
