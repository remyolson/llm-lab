# Task ID: 11
# Title: Initialize Synthetic Data Generation Platform
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up project structure and core dependencies for the synthetic data generation platform
# Details:
Create Python package structure for synthetic data generation platform. Install dependencies: transformers, datasets, pandas, scikit-learn, faker, pydantic.
