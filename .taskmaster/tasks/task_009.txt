# Description: Develop seamless integration components for GitHub Actions, Jenkins, and GitLab CI with security gates and automated reporting
# Details:
Create GitHub Actions workflow templates in .github/workflows/ with pre-built security testing steps. Develop Jenkins plugin with pipeline integration and build status reporting. Create GitLab CI templates with job definitions and artifact handling. Implement RESTful API gateway using FastAPI for custom integrations. Support webhook notifications, pull request blocking on security failures, and progressive security gates by environment. Include automated remediation suggestions and security baseline tracking.

# Test Strategy:
Test GitHub Actions workflow execution in sample repositories. Validate Jenkins plugin installation and pipeline integration. Test GitLab CI template functionality. Verify API gateway endpoints and webhook delivery. Test security gate logic and pull request blocking.
