# Task ID: 23
# Title: Implement Technical Specification Extractor
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 22
# Priority: high
# Description: Build system to automatically extract and document technical implementation details
# Details:
Create TechnicalExtractor class for architecture analysis, dependency mapping, and performance profiling. Extract layer structure, parameter counts, memory requirements, and computational complexity. Document input/output schemas and preprocessing requirements. Generate API documentation from model endpoints. Create dependency trees with version information.

# Test Strategy:
Test extraction accuracy for different architectures. Validate dependency detection completeness. Test performance profiling accuracy. Verify API documentation generation.
