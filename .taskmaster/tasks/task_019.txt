# Task ID: 19
# Title: Implement Batch Processing System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 16, 18
# Priority: low
# Description: Build scalable batch processing for large-scale synthetic data generation
# Details:
Create job queue system for generation requests. Implement parallel processing with multiprocessing/Ray. Build progress tracking and monitoring. Support job scheduling and prioritization. Include failure recovery and retry mechanisms. Create resource management for optimal performance.

# Test Strategy:
Test batch processing with various job sizes. Validate parallel processing efficiency. Test failure recovery mechanisms. Verify resource utilization optimization.
