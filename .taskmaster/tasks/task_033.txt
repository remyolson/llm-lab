# Task ID: 33
# Title: Implement Gradient-Based Attribution
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 32
# Priority: high
# Description: Build feature attribution system using gradient-based methods
# Details:
Create FeatureAttributor class with integrated_gradients(), gradient_x_input(), smooth_grad(), and layer_relevance_propagation() methods. Implement baseline selection strategies. Build attribution aggregation across layers. Create AttributionVisualizer for heatmaps and importance plots. Support batch attribution computation.

# Test Strategy:
Test attribution methods with known ground truth. Validate gradient computation accuracy. Test visualization generation. Verify batch processing efficiency.
