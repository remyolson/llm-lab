# Task ID: 13
# Title: Implement Quality Assessment Framework
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 12
# Priority: high
# Description: Create comprehensive quality validation system for synthetic data
# Details:
Develop quality assessment metrics: statistical similarity (Wasserstein distance), semantic coherence scoring, diversity measurements, utility preservation testing. Implement validators for each metric type. Create quality thresholds and automated quality gates. Build comparison tools for synthetic vs real data distributions. Support custom quality criteria per domain.

# Test Strategy:
Test quality metrics with known good/bad synthetic data. Validate statistical tests accuracy. Test diversity scoring with various datasets. Verify utility preservation through downstream task testing.
