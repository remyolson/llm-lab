# Task ID: 22
# Title: Build Model Card Generator
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 21
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement comprehensive model card generation following industry standards
# Details:
Create ModelCardGenerator class with generate_model_card(), analyze_model_architecture(), and assess_ethical_implications() methods. Extract model overview, performance metrics, training details, and usage guidelines automatically. Support multiple ML frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, Hugging Face). Generate structured model cards in markdown and JSON formats.

# Test Strategy:
Test model card generation for different model types. Validate extracted information accuracy. Test with various ML frameworks. Verify ethical assessment components.
