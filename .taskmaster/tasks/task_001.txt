# Task ID: 1
# Title: Initialize Project Structure and Dependencies
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up the foundational project structure, development environment, and core dependencies for the LLM Security Testing Framework
# Details:
Create Python package structure with setuptools configuration. Initialize virtual environment and install core dependencies: requests, asyncio, pytest, pydantic, click for CLI, fastapi for API endpoints. Set up project directories: src/llm_security/, tests/, docs/, config/. Configure development tools: black, flake8, mypy, pre-commit hooks. Create requirements.txt and setup.py with proper versioning. Initialize git repository with comprehensive .gitignore for Python projects.

# Test Strategy:
Verify package installation, import all core modules, run initial test suite to ensure environment setup is correct. Test CLI entry points and basic module structure.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Project Directory Structure and Virtual Environment [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the base project directory structure and Python virtual environment for isolated dependency management
### Details:
Create main project directory 'llm-security-framework'. Inside, create directories: src/llm_security/ (main package), src/llm_security/__init__.py, tests/, docs/, config/. Set up Python virtual environment using 'python -m venv venv' and activate it. Create initial README.md with project description and setup instructions.

## 2. Configure Python Package Structure and Build System [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Set up proper Python packaging with setuptools configuration for distribution and installation
### Details:
Create setup.py with package metadata, entry points for CLI commands, and dependency specifications. Create setup.cfg for additional configuration. Add pyproject.toml for modern Python packaging with build system requirements. Create MANIFEST.in to include non-Python files. Structure src/llm_security/ with submodules: core/, attacks/, defenses/, utils/, cli/.

## 3. Install and Configure Core Dependencies [done]
### Dependencies: 1.2
### Description: Install all required dependencies and create dependency management files
### Details:
Create requirements.txt with core dependencies: requests>=2.28.0, asyncio, pytest>=7.0.0, pydantic>=2.0.0, click>=8.0.0, fastapi>=0.100.0, uvicorn>=0.23.0. Create requirements-dev.txt with development tools: black, flake8, mypy, pre-commit, pytest-cov, pytest-asyncio. Install all dependencies using pip. Create constraints.txt for version pinning.

## 4. Set Up Development Tools and Code Quality [done]
### Dependencies: 1.3
### Description: Configure code formatting, linting, type checking, and pre-commit hooks for consistent code quality
### Details:
Create .flake8 configuration with appropriate ignore rules. Set up pyproject.toml with black configuration (line-length = 88). Create mypy.ini with type checking rules. Install and configure pre-commit with .pre-commit-config.yaml including hooks for black, flake8, mypy, trailing-whitespace, end-of-file-fixer. Create Makefile with common commands: format, lint, test, clean.

## 5. Initialize Git Repository and Basic Project Files [done]
### Dependencies: 1.4
### Description: Set up version control and create essential project files for a professional Python project
### Details:
Initialize git repository with 'git init'. Create comprehensive .gitignore for Python including: __pycache__/, *.pyc, .env, venv/, .pytest_cache/, .mypy_cache/, dist/, build/, *.egg-info/, .coverage, htmlcov/. Create LICENSE file (MIT or Apache 2.0). Add .editorconfig for consistent coding styles. Create initial src/llm_security/__init__.py with __version__ = '0.1.0'. Create basic pytest.ini configuration. Add GitHub Actions workflow file for CI/CD in .github/workflows/.
