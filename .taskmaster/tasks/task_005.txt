# Task ID: 5
# Title: Create Security Scoring and Risk Assessment System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement standardized security scoring framework based on OWASP LLM Top 10 and custom risk models
# Details:
Develop SecurityScorer class implementing the scoring framework: Jailbreak Resistance (25%), Prompt Injection Defense (25%), Data Leakage Prevention (20%), Input Validation Robustness (15%), Context Manipulation Resistance (15%). Create risk assessment algorithms that aggregate individual vulnerability scores into overall security posture. Support custom risk frameworks and weighting adjustments. Implement severity classification (Critical, High, Medium, Low, Info) with actionable thresholds. Include trend analysis and historical comparison capabilities.

# Test Strategy:
Validate scoring consistency across multiple scan runs. Test score aggregation logic with various vulnerability combinations. Verify severity classification aligns with industry standards. Test custom framework configuration and weighting adjustments.
