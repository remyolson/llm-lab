# Task ID: 31
# Title: Initialize Interpretability Suite
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up core infrastructure for LLM interpretability platform
# Details:
Create project structure: src/interpretability/, analyzers/, visualizers/, explanations/. Install dependencies: transformers, torch, numpy, matplotlib, plotly, dash. Set up model hook system for attention and gradient extraction. Initialize visualization engine foundation. Create configuration for different interpretation methods.

# Test Strategy:
Test model hook installation and data extraction. Verify visualization library integration. Test basic attention extraction from transformer models.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Project Structure and Initialize Package [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the foundational directory structure for the interpretability suite and initialize it as a Python package
### Details:
Create the main project directory 'interpretability-suite' and subdirectories: src/interpretability/, src/interpretability/analyzers/, src/interpretability/visualizers/, src/interpretability/explanations/. Add __init__.py files to all directories to make them Python packages. Create setup.py with package metadata and entry points. Initialize git repository with appropriate .gitignore for Python projects including common ML framework cache directories.

## 2. Install Core Dependencies and Configure Environment [done]
### Dependencies: 31.1
### Description: Set up virtual environment and install all required ML and visualization dependencies
### Details:
Create and activate a virtual environment. Install core dependencies via pip: transformers>=4.30.0, torch>=2.0.0, numpy, matplotlib, plotly, dash, pandas, tqdm. Create requirements.txt with pinned versions for reproducibility. Set up requirements-dev.txt with development tools: pytest, black, flake8, mypy. Configure pyproject.toml for modern Python packaging standards.

## 3. Implement Model Hook System for Feature Extraction [done]
### Dependencies: 31.2
### Description: Create the core hook system for extracting attention weights, activations, and gradients from transformer models
### Details:
In src/interpretability/analyzers/, create hook_manager.py implementing a HookManager class that can register forward and backward hooks on transformer layers. Implement methods to extract attention weights from multi-head attention layers, capture intermediate activations, and record gradients during backpropagation. Create data structures to store extracted features efficiently. Support both HuggingFace and native PyTorch transformer models.

## 4. Initialize Visualization Engine Foundation [done]
### Dependencies: 31.2
### Description: Set up the base visualization system with support for different plot types and interactive dashboards
### Details:
In src/interpretability/visualizers/, create base_visualizer.py with abstract base class for all visualizations. Implement attention_visualizer.py for heatmap-based attention visualization using matplotlib and plotly. Create dashboard_manager.py using Dash for interactive web-based visualizations. Set up template system for consistent styling across all plots. Implement export functionality for static images and interactive HTML.

## 5. Create Configuration System for Interpretation Methods [done]
### Dependencies: 31.3, 31.4
### Description: Implement a flexible configuration system to manage different interpretation methods and their parameters
### Details:
In src/interpretability/, create config.py with InterpretabilityConfig class using pydantic for validation. Define configuration schemas for different interpretation methods: attention analysis, gradient-based methods, activation analysis, integrated gradients. Create method registry to map configuration to implementation. Implement YAML/JSON configuration file support. Add CLI integration for runtime configuration overrides.
