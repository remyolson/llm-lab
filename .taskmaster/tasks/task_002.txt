# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Core Model Adapter System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Build the model adapter interface to support multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure OpenAI, local models)
# Details:
Create abstract ModelAdapter base class with standardized interface methods: send_prompt(), get_response(), handle_errors(). Implement concrete adapters for OpenAI (GPT-3.5/4), Anthropic (Claude), Azure OpenAI, and local model support via HTTP endpoints. Handle authentication, rate limiting, error handling, and response normalization. Support both synchronous and asynchronous operations. Include configuration management for API keys and endpoints. Implement model fingerprinting for consistent identification.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for each adapter with mocked API responses. Integration tests with real API endpoints (using test keys). Verify error handling for invalid credentials, rate limits, and network failures. Test async/sync operation modes.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design and Implement Abstract ModelAdapter Base Class [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the abstract base class that defines the standardized interface for all LLM provider adapters
### Details:
Create src/providers/base.py with abstract ModelAdapter class. Define abstract methods: send_prompt(prompt, **kwargs), get_response(prompt_id), handle_errors(error), configure(config_dict), get_model_info(). Include properties for model_name, provider_name, api_version, is_async_capable. Implement common utilities like request_id generation, timestamp tracking, and response normalization structure. Define standard response format with fields: content, model, tokens_used, latency, metadata.

## 2. Implement Configuration Management System [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Build a robust configuration system for managing API keys, endpoints, and provider-specific settings
### Details:
Create src/config/provider_config.py with ProviderConfig class supporting environment variables, config files (.env, config.yaml), and runtime configuration. Implement secure API key storage with encryption for sensitive data. Create config validation with required/optional fields per provider. Support multi-environment configs (dev, staging, prod). Include rate limit configurations, timeout settings, retry policies, and custom headers. Build config inheritance for shared settings across providers.

## 3. Implement OpenAI and Anthropic Adapters [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.2
### Description: Create concrete adapter implementations for OpenAI (GPT-3.5/4) and Anthropic (Claude) providers
### Details:
Create src/providers/openai.py with OpenAIAdapter class implementing all base methods. Support GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4, and GPT-4-turbo models with proper model selection. Implement streaming responses, function calling, and system messages. Create src/providers/anthropic.py with AnthropicAdapter supporting Claude models. Handle Anthropic's specific prompt format and response structure. Implement proper error handling for both providers including rate limits (429), token limits (400), and API errors (500). Add exponential backoff retry logic.

## 4. Implement Azure OpenAI and Local Model Adapters [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.2
### Description: Create adapters for Azure OpenAI service and generic HTTP endpoint support for local models
### Details:
Create src/providers/azure.py with AzureOpenAIAdapter supporting deployment names, API versions, and Azure-specific authentication. Handle Azure's endpoint format and region-based routing. Create src/providers/local.py with LocalModelAdapter for HTTP endpoint communication. Support configurable request/response formats (JSON schemas). Implement health check endpoints, custom headers, and authentication methods (Bearer, Basic, custom). Add connection pooling for local endpoints to improve performance.

## 5. Implement Async Support and Model Fingerprinting [done]
### Dependencies: 2.3, 2.4
### Description: Add asynchronous operation support and implement model fingerprinting for consistent identification across providers
### Details:
Enhance all adapters with async versions of methods using aiohttp/httpx. Implement AsyncModelAdapter base class with async/await patterns. Create connection pooling for async operations. Build ModelFingerprint class generating unique identifiers based on provider, model name, version, and capabilities. Implement fingerprint caching and validation. Create unified model registry mapping fingerprints to capabilities (context length, supported features, pricing). Add performance monitoring with metrics for latency, tokens/second, and error rates per model.
