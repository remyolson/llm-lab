# Task ID: 34
# Title: Build Concept Activation Analysis
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 33
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement system for understanding high-level concepts learned by models
# Details:
Create ConceptAnalyzer with TCAV implementation, probing classifiers, and concept discovery. Build concept activation vector computation. Implement linguistic concept probing. Create activation clustering for emergent concepts. Support cross-lingual concept analysis. Build concept importance scoring.

# Test Strategy:
Test TCAV computation accuracy. Validate concept discovery results. Test probing classifier training. Verify cross-lingual consistency.
