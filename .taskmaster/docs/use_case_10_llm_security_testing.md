# Product Requirements Document: LLM Security Testing Framework

## Overview

Create a comprehensive security testing framework for Large Language Models that identifies vulnerabilities, tests resilience against attacks, and provides actionable security assessments for enterprise deployment.

## Problem Statement

- **Critical Gap**: LLMs are deployed in production without adequate security testing
