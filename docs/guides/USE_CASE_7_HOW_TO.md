# How to Implement Alignment Research with Runtime Techniques

## 🎯 What You'll Accomplish

By following this guide, you'll be able to:

- Implement runtime alignment techniques for LLMs
- Set up constitutional AI with custom rules
- Create safety filters and intervention systems
- Build preference learning data collection
- Test alignment strategies across models
- Measure and improve model safety metrics

## 📋 Before You Begin

### Prerequisites
- [Initial setup](SETUP.md) completed with API keys
- Python 3.8+ installed
- Understanding of AI safety concepts
- Access to at least 2 different LLM providers
- Basic knowledge of prompt engineering

### Time and Cost Estimates
- **Time to complete**: 1-3 hours
- **Estimated cost**: $5.00-$20.00 (for testing)
- **Skills required**: Advanced Python and AI safety knowledge

### 💰 Cost Breakdown

| Alignment Type | Test Complexity | Models Used | Estimated Cost |
|----------------|-----------------|-------------|----------------|
| Basic Rules | Simple | 2 models | ~$5.00 |
| Safety Filters | Medium | 3 models | ~$10.00 |
| Full Pipeline | Complex | 5+ models | ~$20.00 |

TODO: Balancing safety and utility

#### Issue 2: Inconsistent Interventions
TODO: Debugging rule conflicts

#### Issue 3: Performance Impact
TODO: Optimizing runtime overhead

## 📈 Next Steps

After implementing alignment:
- Test with [Use Case 3: Custom Prompts](USE_CASE_3_HOW_TO.md) for edge cases
- Monitor with [Use Case 8: Continuous Monitoring](USE_CASE_8_HOW_TO.md)
- Fine-tune using [Use Case 6: Fine-tuning](USE_CASE_6_HOW_TO.md) for permanent improvements

## 🎯 Pro Tips

💡 **Start Conservative**: Begin with strict rules, then relax based on testing

💡 **Layer Defenses**: Combine multiple alignment techniques for robustness

💡 **Monitor Metrics**: Track intervention rates to avoid over-filtering

💡 **User Feedback**: Collect preference data for continuous improvement

💡 **Test Edge Cases**: Explicitly test problematic prompts and scenarios
