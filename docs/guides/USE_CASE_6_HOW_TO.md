# How to Fine-tune Local LLMs

## 🎯 What You'll Accomplish

By following this guide, you'll be able to:

- Fine-tune small language models on your own data
- Implement LoRA and QLoRA for efficient training
- Prepare and format training datasets
- Track training progress and evaluate results
- Compare fine-tuned vs base model performance
- Deploy your custom models for production use

## 📋 Before You Begin

### Prerequisites
- [Use Case 5: Local LLM Setup](USE_CASE_5_HOW_TO.md) completed
- Python 3.8+ with PyTorch installed
- GPU with 16GB+ VRAM (recommended)
- Training dataset prepared
- Basic understanding of machine learning concepts

### Time and Cost Estimates
- **Time to complete**: 2-6 hours (including training)
- **Estimated cost**: $0.00 (local compute only)
- **Skills required**: Intermediate Python and ML knowledge

### 💰 Cost Breakdown

| Model Size | Training Time | GPU Memory | Dataset Size | Quality |
|------------|---------------|------------|--------------|---------|
| 0.5B params | 1-2 hours | 8GB | 1K samples | Good |
| 3B params | 2-4 hours | 16GB | 5K samples | Better |
| 7B params | 4-8 hours | 24GB | 10K samples | Best |

## 📈 Next Steps

After fine-tuning your first model:
- Use [Use Case 1: Benchmarking](USE_CASE_1_HOW_TO.md) to evaluate improvements
- Try [Use Case 7: Alignment](USE_CASE_7_HOW_TO.md) for safety improvements
- Deploy with [Use Case 8: Monitoring](USE_CASE_8_HOW_TO.md) for production tracking

## 🎯 Pro Tips

💡 **Data Quality**: Clean data matters more than quantity for fine-tuning

💡 **Start Small**: Use LoRA with small rank before full fine-tuning

💡 **Validation Split**: Always keep 10-20% of data for validation

💡 **Regular Checkpoints**: Save model checkpoints every epoch

💡 **Learning Rate**: Start with recommended rates, adjust based on loss curves
