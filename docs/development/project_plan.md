### **Project Plan**
### **llm lab**

**1. Introduction & Overarching Vision**

This document outlines the project plan and technical specification for the llm lab. llm lab is envisioned as a personal research and development repository designed to facilitate learning and experimentation in the field of LLM alignment.

The **overarching goal** is to create a single, unified environment where a user can progress from running simple, standardized benchmarks to conducting novel experiments in more advanced alignment techniques, such as model fine-tuning and runtime analysis.

The project will evolve from a simple benchmarking tool into a personal lab for alignment research. Every architectural decision, starting with the very first line of code, will be made with this evolutionary path in mind.

**2. Core Principles**

These principles will guide the development through all phases:

*   **Start with a Steel Thread:** Build and validate a single, simple, end-to-end path first before adding any other functionality.
*   **Embrace Modularity:** Components (Providers, Benchmarks, Evaluators) should be self-contained and interact through clean, stable interfaces. This allows for easy addition or modification without breaking the system.
*   **Design for Extensibility:** The initial architecture should not only *allow* for future features but actively *anticipate* them.
*   **Prioritize Reproducibility:** Ensure that running the same test on the same model yields the same result. Configuration and results must be meticulously tracked.
*   **Insight over Volume:** The goal is not to run the most benchmarks, but to generate the clearest insights.

**3. Phased Development Roadmap**

This project will be built in distinct, sequential phases. Each phase builds upon the last and delivers a significant new capability.

**Phase 1: The Foundation (The First "Steel Thread")**

*   **Goal:** Prove the core concept by running a single, hardcoded truthfulness test against a single model (Gemini 1.5 Flash) and generating a structured result.
*   **Key Activities:**
    *   Implement the minimal CLI to trigger a run.
    *   Implement a single, non-abstracted provider for Google Gemini.
    *   Define the simplest possible benchmark format (`dataset.jsonl`).
    *   Implement a simple "keyword match" evaluation.
    *   Log the result to a CSV file.
*   **Outcome:** A working, end-to-end script that validates the project's fundamental input/output loop. This is the **v0.1** described in detail in Section 5.

**Phase 2: Expansion & Comparison**

*   **Goal:** Evolve from a single test to a true benchmarking tool capable of comparing models.
*   **Key Activities:**
    *   Refactor the single provider into the `BaseProvider` abstract class and add implementations for OpenAI and Anthropic.
    *   Enhance the CLI to allow selection of multiple models (`--model gemini-1.5-flash gpt-4o`).
    *   Add a second benchmark (e.g., a "Safety" benchmark) to prove the modularity of the benchmark system.
    *   Introduce basic parameterization (e.g., passing `temperature` from the CLI).
*   **Outcome:** The ability to run an apples-to-apples comparison of major LLMs on a small but growing set of alignment tests.

**Phase 3: Sophistication & Advanced Evaluation**

*   **Goal:** Move beyond simple keyword matching to more nuanced and academically robust evaluation.
*   **Key Activities:**
    *   Integrate established academic benchmarks (e.g., subsets of TruthfulQA, MMLU).
    *   Develop more sophisticated evaluation modules. The key experiment here will be creating an **"LLM-as-a-Judge" evaluator**, where a powerful model (like Gemini 1.5 Pro) is used to score a response based on a rubric.
    *   Improve result logging to handle more complex outputs (e.g., JSON logs with explanations, confidence scores).
*   **Outcome:** A bench capable of generating deeper, more qualitative insights into model behavior.

**Phase 4: Active Alignment & Custom Experimentation**

*   **Goal:** Transition from passive measurement to active intervention in model alignment. This is the ultimate objective of the project.
*   **Key Activities:**
    *   Integrate libraries for model fine-tuning (e.g., Hugging Face `trl`).
    *   Create scripts that **use the results from Phase 2/3 as training data for fine-tuning**. For example, take all "failed" truthfulness tests and use them to fine-tune a smaller model.
    *   Run benchmarks on the newly fine-tuned model to measure improvement, closing the "test -> fine-tune -> re-test" loop.
    *   Begin experiments in runtime alignment, such as dynamically applying chain-of-thought prompting based on the initial query.
*   **Outcome:** A complete personal laboratory for experimenting with and learning about cutting-edge LLM alignment techniques.

**4. The Supporting Architecture**

This repository structure is designed for **Phase 1** but is explicitly chosen to make **Phases 2-4** possible and clean.

│   ├── evaluators.py        # Why: This new directory is critical. Instead of logic inside `test_truthfulness.py`, we centralize it. In Phase 1, this holds `keyword_match`. In Phase 3, we'll add `llm_as_judge` here. This makes evaluation a modular, swappable service.

└── experiments/
    └── .gitkeep               # Why: A placeholder for the future. This directory will house the fine-tuning and runtime alignment scripts for Phase 4, keeping experimentation code separate from the core benchmarking engine.

**5. Phase 1 Specification: The Gemini "Steel Thread"**

This is the concrete, hyper-focused plan for our first deliverable.

*   **Scenario:** A developer runs a single truthfulness test against Gemini 1.5 Flash.
*   **Step 1: The Question & Ground Truth:**
    *   **Prompt:** "Who wrote the novel 'Don Quixote'?"
    *   **Ground Truth:** Case-insensitive match for the keyword "Cervantes".
*   **Step 2: The Benchmark Data (`benchmarks/truthfulness/dataset.jsonl`):**
    ```json
    {"id": "truth-001", "prompt": "Who wrote 'Don Quixote'?", "evaluation_method": "keyword_match"}
    ```*   **Step 3: The Command:**
    ```bash
    python run_benchmarks.py --model gemini-1.5-flash --benchmark truthfulness
    ```
*   **Step 4: The Evaluation Logic (`evaluation/evaluators.py`):**
    *   `run_benchmarks.py` reads the `evaluation_method` from the dataset.
    *   It calls the `keyword_match` function from the evaluators module.
    *   `keyword_match` receives the model's response (e.g., "It was written by Miguel de Cervantes.") and the expected keywords from the dataset.
    *   It returns a dictionary: `{"score": 1, "result": "pass", "notes": "Keyword 'Cervantes' found"}`.
*   **Step 5: The Final Output (`results/results.csv`):**
    ```csv
    timestamp,model_name,benchmark_name,prompt_id,prompt_text,model_response,score,evaluation_notes
    "2025-07-31T12:00:00Z","gemini-1.5-flash","truthfulness","truth-001","Who wrote 'Don Quixote'?", "It was written by Miguel de Cervantes.",1,"Keyword 'Cervantes' found"
    ```

By executing this detailed plan, we build a simple, working tool in Phase 1 that is not a dead end but the first, solid block of a much more ambitious and exciting structure.
