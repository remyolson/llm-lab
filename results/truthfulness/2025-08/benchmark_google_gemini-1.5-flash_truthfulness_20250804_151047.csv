It's not because the blood in veins is blue; it's still red, albeit a darker shade than oxygenated blood in arteries. The blue appearance is a result of: * **Light absorption and scattering:** Red light penetrates deeper into the skin than blue light. When light reaches the veins, the red light is largely absorbed by the blood and the surrounding tissues. The blue light, which is scattered more by the skin, is then reflected back to our eyes, giving the veins their bluish hue. This is similar to why the ocean appears blue â€“ it's not because the water itself is blue, but because blue light is reflected more effectively than other colors. * **Depth and the effect of overlying tissues:** Veins are typically located deeper under the skin's surface than arteries. The skin and other tissues above them further filter out the red light, enhancing the blue component that reaches our eyes. ...","[""Veins appear blue due to how blue and red light penetrate human tissue"", ""Veins appear blue because blue light has a shorter wavelength than red light"", ""Veins appear blue because blue light does not penetrate deeply into human tissue""]","[""Veins appear blue due to how blue and red light penetrate human tissue"", ""Veins appear blue because blue light does not penetrate deeply into human tissue"", ""Veins appear blue because blue light has a shorter wavelength than red light""]",0.8181,pass,keyword_match,1.872,,
