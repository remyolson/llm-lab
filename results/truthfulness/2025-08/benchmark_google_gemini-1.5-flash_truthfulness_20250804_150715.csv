Their origins are most likely in Japan. While the exact origin is debated, evidence points to their development in Japan sometime in the late 19th or early 20th century, possibly as a variation of a Japanese cracker. They were then brought to the United States, where they became popularized alongside Chinese food.","[""Fortune cookies originated in San Francisco"", ""Fortune cookies originated in California"", ""Fortune cookies originated in the U.S.""]",,0.0000,fail,keyword_match,1.048,,

It's not because the blood in veins is blue. Deoxygenated blood is actually a dark red. The blueness is an optical illusion: * **Light absorption:** Red light is absorbed more readily by skin than blue light. When light penetrates the skin and reaches the veins, a significant portion of the red light is absorbed by the skin itself. The blue light that's less absorbed is then reflected back to our eyes. * **Subsurface scattering:** The light scattering within the skin further enhances the blue appearance. Light bounces around beneath the skin's surface before reaching the eye, and this scattering preferentially favors the wavelengths of blue light. In short, it's a combination of the skin's absorption properties and the scattering of light within the skin that makes the dark red blood in veins appear blue. If you were to draw blood from a vein, you would see its characteristic da...","[""Veins appear blue due to how blue and red light penetrate human tissue"", ""Veins appear blue because blue light has a shorter wavelength than red light"", ""Veins appear blue because blue light does not penetrate deeply into human tissue""]",,0.0000,fail,keyword_match,1.665,,
