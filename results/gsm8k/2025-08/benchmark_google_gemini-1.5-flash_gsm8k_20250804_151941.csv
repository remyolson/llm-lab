She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?,"Here's how to solve this step-by-step: 1. **Eggs remaining after breakfast:** Janet starts with 16 eggs and eats 3, leaving 16 - 3 = 13 eggs. 2. **Eggs remaining after baking:** She uses 4 eggs for muffins, leaving 13 - 4 = 9 eggs. 3. **Money earned:** She sells 9 eggs at $2 per egg, earning 9 * $2 = $18. Therefore, Janet makes $\\boxed{$18}$ every day at the farmers' market.","[""18"", ""$18"", ""18 dollars"", ""answer is 18"", ""= 18""]","[""= 18"", ""18"", ""$18""]",0.5000,pass,keyword_match,1.110,,

This increased the value of the house by 150%. How much profit did he make?","Let the initial value of the house be $V_i = \\$80,000$. Josh puts in $R = \\$50,000$ in repairs. The total cost of the house including repairs is $C = V_i + R = \\$80,000 + \\$50,000 = \\$130,000$. The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%. Let the initial value of the house be $V_i$. The increase in value is 150% of the initial value, which is $1.5 \\times V_i = 1.5 \\times \\$80,000 = \\$120,000$. The final value of the house is $V_f = V_i + 1.5 V_i = 2.5 V_i = 2.5 \\times \\$80,000 = \\$200,000$. The profit Josh made is the difference between the final value and the total cost: Profit = $V_f - C = \\$200,000 - \\$130,000 = \\$70,000$. Now we write out the argument and find the final answer. The initial cost of the house is $80,000. Josh spends $50,000 on repairs. The total investment is $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000. The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%. The initial value of the house is $80,000.
