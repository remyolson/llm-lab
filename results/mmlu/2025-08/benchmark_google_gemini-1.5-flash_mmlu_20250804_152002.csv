Choices: A. 0 B. 4 C. 2 D. 6 Answer:","Let K = Q(√2, √3, √18). We want to find the degree [K:Q]. We have √18 = √(9*2) = 3√2. Since 3 and √2 are already in Q(√2, √3), then √18 is also in Q(√2, √3). Therefore, K = Q(√2, √3). Consider the tower of fields Q ⊂ Q(√2) ⊂ Q(√2, √3). [Q(√2):Q] = 2 because the minimal polynomial of √2 over Q is x² - 2, which is irreducible by Eisenstein's criterion with p=2. Now consider Q(√2, √3) over Q(√2). The minimal polynomial of √3 over Q(√2) is x² - 3. If this polynomial were reducible in Q(√2)[x], then √3 would be in Q(√2), meaning √3 = a + b√2 for some a, b ∈ Q. Squaring both sides gives 3 = a² + 2b² + 2ab√2. This implies that 2ab = 0, so either a = 0 or b = 0. If a = 0, then 3 = 2b², which is impossible for rational b. If b = 0, then 3 = a², which is also impossible for rational a. Therefore, x² - 3 is irreducible over Q(√2), and [Q(√2, √3):Q(√2)] = 2. By the tower law, [Q(√2, √3):Q] = [Q(√2, √3):Q(√2)] * [Q(√2):Q] = 2 * 2 = 4. Therefore, the degree of the field extension Q(√...","[""4"", ""B."", ""(B)"", ""B""]","[""B"", ""4"", ""(B)"", ""B.""]",0.5000,pass,keyword_match,3.345,,

Choices: A. 8 B. 2 C. 24 D. 120 Answer:","Here's how to solve this problem: **1. Simplify the permutation:** The permutation p = (1, 2, 5, 4)(2, 3) can be simplified by composing the cycles. Start by applying (2,3) to (1,2,5,4): * 1 goes to 2, then 2 goes to 3, resulting in (1,3,5,4,2) So, p = (1, 3, 5, 4, 2) which is a 5-cycle. **2. Order of the subgroup:** The order of a cycle is its length. Therefore, the order of <p> (the subgroup generated by p) is 5. This means <p> contains 5 elements: the identity (e), p, p², p³, and p⁴. **3. Index of the subgroup:** The index of a subgroup H in a group G, denoted [G:H], is the number of left (or right) cosets of H in G. It's calculated as |G|/|H|, where |G| is the order of G and |H| is the order of H. * |G| = |S₅| = 5! = 120 (the order of the symmetric group S₅) * |H| = |<p>| = 5 (the order of the subgroup generated by p) Therefore, the index of <p> in S₅ is: [S₅ : <p>] = |S₅| / |<p>| = 120 / 5 = 24 **Answer:** C. 24","[""24"", ""C."", ""(C)"", ""C""]","[""C"", ""24"", ""C."", ""(C)""]",0.5000,pass,keyword_match,2.733,,
