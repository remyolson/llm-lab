# Task 13 Implementation Summary

## What was implemented:

### 1. AnthropicProvider Class (`llm_providers/anthropic.py`)
- Full implementation of Anthropic Claude provider supporting all Claude 3 models
- Proper inheritance from `LLMProvider` base class
- Support for Claude 3 Opus, Sonnet, Haiku, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and legacy Claude 2 models
- Automatic registration with the provider registry using `@register_provider` decorator

### 2. Key Features:
- **Authentication**: Uses `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable
- **Message Format Conversion**: Converts between simple prompts and Anthropic's messages API format
- **Model Information**: Detailed model metadata including context windows and output limits
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for rate limits, timeouts, and authentication errors
- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff for rate limit errors with configurable retries
- **Parameter Validation**: Ensures max_tokens doesn't exceed model limits

### 3. Test Suite (`tests/test_anthropic_provider.py`)
- 18 comprehensive unit tests covering:
  - Provider initialization
  - Credential validation
  - Message format conversion
  - Text generation with various scenarios
  - Error handling (rate limits, timeouts, authentication)
  - Model information retrieval
  - Custom parameter handling
- Optional integration tests for real API validation
- All tests passing

### 4. Integration:
- Updated `llm_providers/__init__.py` to export AnthropicProvider
- Verified compatibility with existing provider registry system
- Follows same patterns as GoogleProvider for consistency

## Alignment with Task 12 (OpenAI Provider):
- Both providers follow the same base class interface
- Both use environment variables for API keys (OPENAI_API_KEY vs ANTHROPIC_API_KEY)
- Both implement similar error handling patterns
- Both are registered with the provider registry
- Both have comprehensive test suites with mocked API responses

## Notes:
- The anthropic package was added to requirements.txt (already present)
- Model selection is done via model_name parameter, not API key
- Supports both legacy (Human:/Assistant:) and modern messages format
- Ready for integration with the orchestration system
